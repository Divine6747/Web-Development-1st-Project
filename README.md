# Web Development 1 Project â€“ Dyesebel Jewellery Website
For my final Web Development 1 project, I designed and built a jewellery website for a fictional company named Dyesebel. I researched various jewellery websites to gather ideas and inspiration for visually appealing and user-friendly designs.

I created the company logo using FreeLogoDesign.org and developed the site using HTML and CSS. I really enjoyed the creative process and gained valuable experience in design, layout, and front-end development.
